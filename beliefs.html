              How to Go to Heaven
            </h2>
            <div class="section-content">
              <p>
                Romans is a letter written by a man named Paul to a church
                located in Rome almost 2000 years ago. He wrote it by the
                inspiration of God. Perhaps it would be better to say it this
                way: God wrote the letter by putting his spirit in Paul. The
                letter was written so that a person might learn how they can go
                to heaven. It is highly recommended that you read the whole
                letter, but we'll try to give a summary here.
              </p>

              <h3>Here's what Paul taught:</h3>
              <p>
                First of all, there is some good news. God grants salvation to
                anyone who believes and lives according to that belief. "Anyone"
                includes you! It doesn't matter what is in your past! Paul took
                great joy in this and was glad to tell others about it, but he
                encountered a lot of trouble as he did. That's why he wrote: "I
                am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for
                the salvation of everyone who believes..."
                <a
                  href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A16&version=NIV"
                  >(Romans 1:16)</a
                >.
              </p>

              <h3>Our Predicament: All Are Sinners</h3>
              <p>
                Paul goes on to explain what this good news is by first
                explaining our predicament. We are all sinners.
                <a
                  href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A23&version=NIV"
                  >Romans 3:23</a
                >
                explains, "...for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of
                God..." Murder, sexual immorality, drunkenness, stealing, lying,
                cheating, swindling, gossiping, slandering, disobeying parents,
                it doesn't matter which describes your sin, because of that sin
                we fall short of "the glory of God." We have a tendency to rate
                sin into different categories because sin does different kinds
                of damage. For example, a lie would damage trust and a
                relationship between two people, but murder would damage every
                relationship to which that life was attached. Therefore, we hold
                the sin of murder as being much worse than lying. Sometimes we
                even get smug about it and look down our noses at those who have
                committed bigger sins than we have. But in God's eyes, in regard
                to who goes to heaven, we fall short of God's glory too. A
                student who gets a "D" on a test and mocks the student who got
                an "F" still fails! We have all failed and don't deserve to go
                to heaven.
              </p>
              <h3>Recognizing Sin and Repentance</h3>
              <p>
                Until a person can recognize their sin and repent of it, they'll
                never be able to make it to heaven. But there is good news:
                <a
                  href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A23&version=NIV"
                  >Romans 6:23</a
                >
                tells us, "the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is
                eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."
              </p>
              <h3>God's Salvation Through Jesus</h3>
              <p>
                God has made it possible for us to turn away from sin and turn
                to Him and have salvation because of what he did through His
                son, Jesus.
                <a
                  href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A8&version=NIV"
                  >Romans 5:8</a
                >
                says, "God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we
                were still sinners, Christ died for us." A good way of
                portraying what Jesus did for us is to think about our life
                being represented in a report card. Jesus never sinned, not even
                once. He got a report card that showed straight "A's". But we
                have all sinned and failed. We've got "D's" and "F's" across the
                board. To deserve heaven, there's no curve. We must have perfect
                "A's". Jesus took our place. He took our punishment and allowed
                us to have His "A's" so that we might be permitted into heaven.
                Where sin separated us from God, Jesus' sacrifice restored us to
                our Heavenly Father.
              </p>
              <h3>Confession, Belief, and Baptism</h3>
              <p>
                Now you may be wondering, "How do I get on this bandwagon?"
                <a
                  href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+10%3A9&version=NIV"
                  >Romans 10:9</a
                >
                reads, "if you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and
                believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you
                will be saved." We are saved by faith. How do you know you have
                that faith? By living what you believe. Scripture also teaches
                that our sins are washed away in a significant activity called
                Baptism. When Paul wrote his letter to the church in Rome, he
                was reminding the believers of all these things and encouraging
                them not to sin by reminding them of the day they were baptized
                and what it meant.
                <a
                  href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A4&version=NIV"
                  >Romans 6:4</a
                >, "We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death
                in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through
                the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."
              </p>
              <h3>New Life in Christ</h3>
              <p>
                When a person is baptized they are dipped down into water much
                like a body is laid into a coffin and a spiritual death takes
                place: the death of our former way of life and the death of sin.
                We are conjoined with Christ's death in this moment and then we
                come up out of the water, just as Jesus rose from the dead and
                all Christians will rise from death. We rise as new creations,
                followers of Jesus Christ, learning to be more like Him.
              </p>
              <h3>Continuous Renewal and Living with Faith</h3>
              <p>
                After repenting, confessing, and being baptized, a person can
                rest assured that Jesus' blood is continually washing their sins
                away, even sins we commit after being baptized. We can live with
                renewed hope and motivation, thankful to God for his love for us
                and what he has done for us through His son Jesus. That's why
                Paul goes on to write to the church in Rome, "Therefore, I urge
                you, brothers, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as
                living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God - this is your
                spiritual act of worship. Do not conform any longer to the
                pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of
                your mind"
