              <h3>Agape Love</h3>
              <p>
                This word comes up quite often in Christian circles. Its origin
                is based on the original Greek language which was used at the
                time the New Testament was written. At that time, there were a
                variety of words used to describe good human relationships, as
                found in families, in friendships, and in romantic contexts. As
                Christianity developed, based on the example and identity of the
                risen Lord Jesus Christ, this new aspect of love began to shine
                out in those communities. In contrast to the other more common
                understandings of relationship, agape love became distinctive in
                nature. The outstanding quality of agape love is its capacity to
                care for another person by an act of the will. It is not based
                on benefit for the giver or on the feelings of the giver, which
                is usually the case for 'ordinary' human care. When Christians
                talk about agape love, they are referring to this divine love
                revealed by Jesus. The Bible challenges each of us to love all
                people like that. The Bible also promises us that God will equip
                and enable us to love people with this agape love as we ask for
                and are open to His Spirit's help each day.
              </p>

              <h3>Baptism</h3>
              <p>
                When it's used in the Bible, the word "baptism" means
                "immersion", not sprinkling. It carries the picture of being
                completely covered. When you're at the beach and your whole body
                goes under the water, that's baptism. When a shirt is dipped
                into a colored dye so that the shirt is completely covered by
                the dye, that's baptism. When Christians are baptized by
                immersion, their whole body goes under the water and they are
                identifying with the death of Jesus. When they come back up out
                of the water, they are identifying with the new life of Jesus.
              </p>

              <h3>Born Again</h3>
              <p>
                Sometimes, Christians say they have been born again. They get
                this phrase from a conversation Jesus had with a spiritual
                leader of his day, Nicodemus. Jesus told Nicodemus that unless a
                person is born again, he cannot enter God's Kingdom. The second
                birth Jesus talked about was not a physical birth, but a
                spiritual birth. This is what being born again means - getting a
                new, spiritual life. It means that a person has something added,
                which fills a gap. When someone is born again, God promises that
                they have new life with a purpose and a hope for the future.
              </p>
              <h3>Canon</h3>
              <p>
                Canon refers to those books which are understood to be divinely
                inspired, the books of the Old and New Testament.
              </p>

              <h3>Christ</h3>
              <p>
                The Jews were for centuries waiting for a promised Messiah who
                would deliver them from oppression. Many Jews are still waiting.
                The word Messiah means "anointed by God", and the word "Christ"
                is the Greek translation of the word Messiah. So when we say
                Jesus Christ, we don't mean that Christ was His surname! Jesus
                Christ could better be translated as "The anointed one from God,
                who saves us."
              </p>

              <h3>Christians</h3>
              <p>
                This word basically means "little Christs". Many scholars
                believe it was originally a name of scorn when Acts 11:26 states
                the disciples were "first called Christians". In Antioch, Luke
                uses a word that the New Testament usually applies to an
                announcement from God.
              </p>

              <h3>Confess</h3>
              <p>
                In the language of the Bible, the word confess means "say the
                same thing". When a parent discovers that her child has been
                doing something wrong, she might bring this to the child's
                attention. She's hoping that her child will confess to his
                mother. When the child does so, he is saying what the mother is
                saying: that the child has done wrong. In the relationship
                between God and people, the same applies. When we confess to
                God, we're telling God that we've done wrong in his eyes. God
                already knows this, but our confession shows that we agree with
                God's assessment. It allows God to forgive us as well. That's
                what it means in the Bible where it says "If we confess our
                sins, God will forgive our sins..."
              </p>
              <h3>Covenant</h3>
              <p>
                A permanent agreement such as a wedding vow. When used in a
                Christian context, it usually refers to either the new or the
                old covenant between God and man. The first covenant was an
                agreement God made with the Jews, whereby he gave them the land
                of Israel, peace and prosperity. In return, they were supposed
                to obey his commands and preserve his word. Being sinful human
                beings like all of us, they failed to do so. The new covenant is
                the Christian religion. It is a reconciliation between God and
                man sealed with the blood of Jesus.
              </p>

              <h3>Crucifixion</h3>
              <p>
                The method the Romans used to execute Jesus Christ. It was the
                most painful and degrading form of capital punishment in the
                ancient world. The Greeks and Romans at first reserved the
                punishment only for slaves, saying it was too barbaric for
                freeborn or citizens. By the first century, it was used for any
                enemy of the state, though citizens could only be crucified by
                direct edict of Caesar. As time went on, the Romans began to use
                crucifixion more and more as a deterrent to criminal activity,
                so that by Jesus' time it was a common sight. A tablet detailing
                the crime(s) was often placed around the criminal's neck and
                then fastened to the cross. At the site, the prisoner was often
                tied (the normal method) or nailed (if a quicker death was
                desired) to the crossbeam. The nail would be driven through the
                wrist rather than the palm, since the smaller bones of the hand
                could not support the weight of the body. The beam with the body
                was then lifted and tied to the already affixed upright pole.
                Pins or a small wooden block were placed halfway up to provide a
                seat for the body lest the nails tear open the wounds or the
                ropes force the arms from their sockets. Finally, the feet were
                tied or nailed to the post. Death was caused by the loss of
                blood circulation and coronary failure.
              </p>

              <h3>Epistles</h3>
              <p>
                "Epistle" means letter. The Epistles are the letters written to
                the early church in the time of the apostles. Most of the
                Epistles were written by an apostle. No one knows who wrote the
                book of Hebrews. The book of James was written by the brother of
                Jesus. Revelation, which is called the Apocalypse in the
                Catholic Bible, does not appear to be a letter by modern
                standards but it was written as a letter to be shared among the
                churches.
              </p>

              <h3>Gospel</h3>
              <p>
                This word simply means good news: the glorious message that
                Christ has bought, through his death on the cross and
                resurrection from the dead, forgiveness of sins for all who
                cling to him in faith.
              </p>

              <h3>Gospels</h3>
              <p>
                The first four books of the New Testament: Matthew, Mark, Luke
                and John. They tell of the life, death, and resurrection of
                Jesus. The first three are called the synoptic gospels since
                they tend to have the same events and outline. John is different
                in that it tells the story of the life of Jesus using a
                different outline and different focus. If you want to start
                reading the bible, John is a very good place to start.
              </p>

              <h3>Grace</h3>
              <p>
                They say there's no such thing as a free lunch. There is with
                God. Even better, God offers us a free gift of a changed life,
                freedom from guilt, and a clear conscience. We don't have to do
                anything to earn it. In fact, we can't. If we could earn it, it
                wouldn't be a gift. That's the essence of grace: God's free gift
                to us with no strings attached.
              </p>

              <h3>Holy</h3>
              <p>
                These days, the word "holy" is generally used in common speech
                with no thought to its relevance or significance. However,
                Christians make the claim that God is holy. This word
                essentially means "separate" and the underlying idea is that God
                is fundamentally separate from evil. God has always been holy
                and will always be holy. As well as describing God, the word
                holy can also be used to describe people or things which are set
                apart or sacred. Another meaning of the word is moral purity.
                Christians are called to be holy before God and before people.
                This means they are to live their lives in a way which is
                morally good; a way which makes God look good and which shows
                that God is holy.
              </p>

              <h3>Judgment Day</h3>
              <p>
                Also known as the last day. This is the day when Christ will
                come again in glory, raise all the dead, and bring all believers
                into heaven.
              </p>

              <h3>Justification</h3>
              <p>
                This is a legal term which talks about the legal aspect of
                salvation. Every one of us stands guilty before God because we
                have broken His law. When God justifies a person, He declares
                that person to be in right standing before Him. Even though that
                person will still sin, he or she is legally free from blame and
                guilt as far as God is concerned.
              </p>

              <h3>Reconciliation</h3>
              <p>
                When a person is reconciled to God, it means that their
                relationship with God has changed. Prior to being reconciled,
                the person is an "enemy" of God because of sin. After
                reconciliation with God, the person has a secure and everlasting
                relationship with God. There cannot be true harmony in a
                relationship while there is some problem. Once a person fully
                trusts in Jesus, that person is reconciled to God.
              </p>

              <h3>Redemption</h3>
              <p>
                Redemption means a "buying back". It comes from the practice in
                the ancient world where a slave could be "redeemed". Perhaps
                initially, a person had to be sold into slavery because of some
                debt he could not pay. From that point onwards, the person was a
                slave of the one who bought him. If a friend or a benefactor
                paid for his freedom, he became free! He was bought back from
                the slave-owner and was completely free after that. This is a
                picture of how God buys us back from slavery to sin. He pays for
                our freedom by offering Jesus in our place.
              </p>

              <h3>Repentance</h3>
              <p>
                Repentance means a change of mind and a change of life. When
                someone repents from their sin, they make a deliberate decision
                to turn away from sin and to turn towards God. This does not
                mean that person will never sin again. It does mean they have
                made a conscious choice to follow after God and stop chasing
                after sin.
